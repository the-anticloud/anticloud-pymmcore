## What This Project Is

`pymmcore-plus` extends [pymmcore](https://github.com/micro-manager/pymmcore) (python bindings for the C++ [micro-manager core](https://github.com/micro-manager/mmCoreAndDevices/)) with a number of features designed to facilitate working with **Micro-manager in pure python/C environments**.

This is the upstream project, vendored at the pinned commit above and packaged offline-first. The 12 improvements Anticloud adds live in `anticloud/` and are described under *Anticloud Overlay* below. Every fact in this file traces to a file in this directory.

## Installation

from pip

```sh
pip install pymmcore-plus

## Usage

Then use the core object as you would `pymmcore.CMMCore`...
but with [more features](https://pymmcore-plus.github.io/pymmcore-plus/api/cmmcoreplus/) :smile:

```python
from pymmcore_plus import CMMCorePlus

core = CMMCorePlus()
...
```

## Anticloud Overlay

The 12 improvements live under `anticloud/`. Run the check suite from this directory:

```
python anticloud/bench/runner.py --cwd anticloud
```

Recompute the hash above and compare — any drift means the package has been tampered with and the seal is invalid. This is a self-assessment; no external audit has been performed and a SOC 2 / NIST independent audit is committed post-funding.
